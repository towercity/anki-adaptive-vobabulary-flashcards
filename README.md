# Adaptive Vobabulary Flashcards for Anki 2.0+

A useful vocabulary flashcard template for Anki that creates cards for variety of study methods from one note.

_Note: because I've been using Anki to study Japanese from English, all examples on this page will reference either Japanese or English. For your own use, however, there's nothing in this template that won't work simply because you aren't learning Japanese (so far as I know). It simply has some extra features for Japanese use._
